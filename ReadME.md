## Program Overview & Purpose 

This microservice is designed to intake data through an endpoint, process the data, update it as necessary, and then store the resultant information. It also features a scheduling mechanism for batch processing and an automated cleanup task that deletes data every 24 hours to maintain data hygiene

## API (api.py)

Purpose: This file defines the API endpoints for the microservice, handling the application's core functionality including data reception, processing, and sending responses to clients.

### Key Features:

Endpoints Definition: It hosts the definitions of all RESTful API endpoints. This includes the primary endpoint that takes in data, processes it, and might allocate it for scheduled updates or deletion.

Request Handlers: Each endpoint comes with a request handler that processes incoming requests, performs necessary actions (like data transformation), and formulates responses.

Dependency Injection: Utilizes FastAPI's dependency injection system for various components like database connections or service classes, making the code more modular and testable.

Purpose: This module is responsible for configuring the logging for the microservice. It's essential for debugging, monitoring, and auditing the application's behavior over time.

Logging Configuration: Sets up the global logging configuration for the application, including log levels, formats, and destinations (e.g., console, file, or external monitoring services).

Utility Functions: May include utility functions to facilitate more granular logging throughout the application, like context-specific logs for tracing data processing stages or errors.

## Main (main.py)

### Purpose: 

Serves as the entry point for the microservice. It initializes the application, sets up dependencies (like OpenTelemetry for tracing), and starts the web server.

### Key Features:

OpenTelemetry Setup: Initializes OpenTelemetry tracing to monitor and trace the application's behavior and performance.

Application Initialization: Runs necessary setup functions, including starting the FastAPI application and any required initializations for the API or scheduled tasks.

Web Server Configuration: Configures and runs the Uvicorn ASGI server, defining host, port, and other operational settings.

This is covered in the existing documentation segment for main.py, showing how to set up OpenTelemetry, configure the FastAPI application, and start the Uvicorn server.

### Conclusion

The microservice's functionality is spread across multiple Python modules, each with a distinct responsibility. api.py defines the behavior of the API endpoints, log.py configures logging for operational visibility, and main.py ties everything together, bootstrapping the application. Documenting each module separately provides clarity on the microservice architecture, making maintenance and development more manageable.
